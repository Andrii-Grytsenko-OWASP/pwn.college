For conversion between integer and bytes (to and from) there are two functons of int object:
int.from_bytes() to convert from bytes to integer
int.to_butes() to convert from int to bytes

int.from_bytes(bytes, byteorder, *, signed=False)
byteorder -> "big", "little"

int.to_bytes(byte_length, byteorder)
byte_length -> in how many bytes int should be converted to
byteorder -> "big", "little"
